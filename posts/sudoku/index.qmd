I joined Kainos in July 2021 as a placement student, where I took part in their 7 week AI Academy. 
The culminating event of the programme was to plan, develop, and present an individual capstone project.
I published a blog about the project on the Kainos website which you can find [here](https://www.kainos.com/insights/blogs/ai-academy-capstone-projects--improving-document-data-extraction-through-contextualisation-computer-vision-based-sudoku-solver).
