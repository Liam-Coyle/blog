Do this now. (This doesn’t have to match your windows username.) You will also be prompted to create a password. Note that the letters are invisible for security reasons.\n\n\nStep 8 - Close Ubuntu terminal & make sure your Ubuntu installation is running version 2 of WSL.\nClose the Ubuntu terminal, and in your windows command prompt in administrator mode, run wsl.exe --set-version Ubuntu 2\n\n\nStep 9 - Make sure your Ubuntu installation is runing version 2\nwsl.exe --set-version Ubuntu 2\n\n\nStep 10 - Restart WSL again\nwsl --shutdown\nYou should now have WSL2 with Ubuntu properly installed. To launch WSL, either type wsl in windows command prompt to enter into the linux environment. You can check the Ubuntu version with the command lsb_release -a inside your linux environment."

    "text": "Fixing DNS issues\nSometimes there can be problems with DNS within WSL. If you have DNS issues, these steps should fix them. Run the following commands in the WSL environment (unless otherwise specified.)\n\nStep 1 - Remove resolv.conf file\nsudo rm -Rf resolv.conf\n\n\nStep 2 - Check your DNS servers\nIn windows command prompt, run ipconfig /all and find the line ‘DNS Servers’ under the network adapter you are using. In my case, this was ‘Wireless Lan adapter Wi-Fi’. Take note of these DNS Servers.\n\n\nStep 3 - Edit resolv.conf\nRun sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf. Write the following into the file:\nnamespace xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\nnamespace xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\nwhere xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is replaced by the DNS servers from the previous step (you can list as many as you like here.) Press CTRL + o, then Enter to save the file name, then CTRL + x to edit the text editor.\n\n\nStep 4 - Make resolv.conf immutable\nsudo chattr -f +i /etc/resolv.conf\nNote: If you want to undo this later, you can do sudo chattr -f -i /etc/resolv.conf\n\n\nStep 5 - Edit wsl.conf\nsudo bash -c 'echo \"[network]\" > /etc/wsl.conf' sudo bash -c 'echo \"generateResolvConf = false\" >> /etc/wsl.conf'\n\n\nStep 6 - Restart WSL\nwsl --shutdown\n\n\nStep 7 - Relaunch WSL + check resolv.conf hasn’t changed\nRelaunch WSL with wsl, and run cat /etc/resolv.conf. This should print the contents of resolv.conf to the terminal. This should match what you wrote to the file in step 3. If not, something has gone wrong.\nYour DNS server should now be configured properly. Note: If you change connection you may need to re-do these steps."
