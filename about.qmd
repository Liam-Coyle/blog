I am a final year Computer Science student at Queen's University Belfast with a strong interest in ML, data science, and MLOps. 

During my time working as a Trainee ML Engineer at Kainos, I worked on multiple internal projects end-to-end, in areas such as supply chain optimisation, recommendation systems, 
and MLOps deployment/monitoring.

I am currently working on my final year project in the area of unsupervised semantic segmentation.
