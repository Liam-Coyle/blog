I am a final year Computer Science student at Queen's University Belfast with a strong interest in Data science, ML, and MLOps. 

During my time working as a Trainee ML Engineer at [Kainos](https://www.kainos.com/), I worked on multiple internal projects end-to-end in areas such as recommendation systems, supply chain optimisation, and MLOps deployment/monitoring.
